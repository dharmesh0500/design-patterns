# What is Abstract Factory Design Pattern 
Abstract factory is also called as factory of factories. Abstract Factory patterns work around a super-factory which creates other factories. In Abstract Factory pattern an interface is responsible for creating a factory of related objects without explicitly specifying their classes. Each generated factory can give the objects as per the Factory pattern.

### When to use Abstract Factory Design Pattern 
When application needs a level of indirection that abstracts the creation of families of related or dependent objects without directly specifying their concrete classes. The "factory" object has the responsibility for providing creation services for the entire platform family.

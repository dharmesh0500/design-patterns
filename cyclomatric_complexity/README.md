# What is Cyclomatic Complexity?
Cyclomatic complexity is a source code complexity measurement that is being correlated to a number of coding errors. It is calculated by developing a Control Flow Graph of the code that measures the number of linearly-independent paths through a program module.

Lower the Program's cyclomatic complexity, lower the risk to modify and easier to understand. 
Cyclomatic complexity = E - N + 2*P 
where,
*  E = number of edges in the flow graph.
*  N = number of nodes in the flow graph.
*  P = number of nodes that have exit points
  

If the decision points are more, then complexity of the program is more. If program has high complexity number, then probability of error is high with increased time for maintenance and trouble shoot.
#### Try to write linear code, which means wrap logic in reusable methods and use them.

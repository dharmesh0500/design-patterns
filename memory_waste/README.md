# What is memory issue / memory wastage
Memory is one of the most critical resource of a software program and it should be used wisely. 
A memory leak reduces the performance of the computer by reducing the amount of available memory. Eventually, in the worst case, too much of the available memory may become allocated and part of the system or device stops working correctly, the application fails, or the system slows down

Each design pattern is focused to solve certain problem and it might have few side effects as well. A design that worked on a small software might not work on big enterprise software.

Hence, First thing is to find the primary target of the design and then pick and choose the design pattern based on issue in hand.

# What is Strategy Design Pattern 
Strategy pattern  is a behavioral software design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm at runtime. The strategy pattern
* Defines a family of algorithms,
* Encapsulates each algorithm, and
* Makes the algorithms interchangeable within that family.

### When to use Strategy Design Pattern 
Strategy pattern is useful when we have multiple algorithms for specific task and we want our application to be flexible to chose any of the algorithm at runtime for specific task.
